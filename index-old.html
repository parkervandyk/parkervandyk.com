          <p>My name is Parker Van Dyk and I grew up in Dallas, Texas.</p>
          <p>
            Went to the University of Alabama and studied Management Information
            Systems.
          </p>
          <p>I worked in Atlanta for a few years and enjoyed my time there.</p>
          <p>
            After Atlanta, I moved to Nashville and that's really where my
            career started.
          </p>
          <p>Now I live in Austin, and it's by far my favorite.</p>
          <p>
            I strive to be active when I'm not

          </p>
          <p>
            I really love

            me swimming laps.

            Here are a few things that are important to me

            about the world around me.
          </p>
          <p>

            my team.

            rideshare startup here in Austin and had a really fun time.
          </p>
